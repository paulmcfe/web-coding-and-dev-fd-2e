            <b>Note:</b> Creating a new word by chopping off the initial letter or syllable of an existing word is called <i>aphaeresis</i> (which means “to take away”). This not-as-uncommon-as-you-might-think process was the source of words such as <i>mend</i> (a shortening of <i>amend</i>), <i>spy</i> (from <i>espy</i>), <i>cute</i> (from <i>acute</i>), and <i>squire</i> (from <i>esquire</i>).
